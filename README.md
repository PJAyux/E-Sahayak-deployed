# E-Sahayak
e-Sahayak is an online platform where citizens can easily submit complaints about social and community issues. We quickly route these concerns to the nearest NGOs, ensuring prompt action. By bridging the gap between the public and NGOs, e-Sahayak helps drive effective and faster solutions.
